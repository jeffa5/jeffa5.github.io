title: "Owork"
---

Owork is a productivity timer written in OCaml. It provides four states of
work: `idle`, `working`, `short break` and `long break`. The times for each
duration are configurable and the user can create their own scripts to interact
with the server.

This should encourage regular breaks from work to get up and about while also
encouraging focus for the duration of sessions. The exact principle the user
wants to follow is completely up to them provided it fits into the states of
work.

Since it is just a server custom scripts can be used to:
- send requests to the server
- notify the user of a change of state
- get the state of the timer from the server
