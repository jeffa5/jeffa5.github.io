title: "Block breaker"
---

Block breaker is a fun game for killing time. There is a library component and
frontend implementations. It doesn't make use of a game engine or anything and
is just some simple Rust modules stitched together.

Since I spend a lot of time in the terminal I created an accompanying tui
frontend. This is quite nice and certainly enough for this simple game.
